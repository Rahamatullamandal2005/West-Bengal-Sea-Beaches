It was mentioned as the "Brighton of the East" in one of the letters of Warren Hastings(1780 AD) to his wife.<br><br>Also In 1923, an English tourist John Frank Smith was charmed by the beauty of Digha and started living here. His writings about Digha slowly gave exposure of this place. After independence, he convinced chief minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy to develop Digha as a beach resort. </p>
